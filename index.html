              <p> Jewelry in the Americas has an ancient history. Beginning 
                as far back as 8800 BCE, Paleo-Indians in the American Southwest 
                drilled and shaped multicolored stones and shells into beads and 
                pendants. Olivella shell beads, dating from 6000 BCE, were found 
                in Nevada; bone, antler, and possibly marine shell beads from 7000 
                BCE were found in Russell Cave in Alabama; copper jewelry was traded 
                from Lake Superior beginning in 3000 BCE; and stone beads were carved 
                in Poverty Point in Louisiana in 1500 BCE. <a href="#">Learn more</a>. </p>
